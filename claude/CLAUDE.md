# Preferences

## Code Style
- Always use US English spelling.
- Mimic the code style of the surrounding modules

## Commands
- Use "bzl" instead of "bazel" for all commands that need bazel

## Commit Messages
- No emojis. Before crafting them, ask me for any additional context or motivation.
- Use the imperative: "Fix bug," not "Fixed bug."

## Debugging
- When debugging issues, ask clarifying questions before assuming the root cause. Validate assumptions with the user before pursuing a fix path.

## Final Steps
- Tell me what permissions I can safely add to `~/.claude/settings.json` to make future work faster
